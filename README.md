# sales-forecasting
This project aims to develop a model using ARIMA &amp; Seasonal ARIMA to forecast future sales of Perrin Freres champagne


The general process for ARIMA/Seasonal ARIMA models is the following:
-> Visualize the Time Series Data
-> Make the time series data stationary
-> Plot the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts
-> Construct the ARIMA or Seasonal ARIMA models based on the data
-> Use the model to make predictions
